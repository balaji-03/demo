Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.
Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported,
and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[59] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[60] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[61][62] and logic programming.[63]

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Readability counts.
